To Do
=====

Ian
---
* Add a favicon
* Submit the finished product to the DP
* Figure out what to display after submission is complete
* Add in "default" thumbnail image
* (optional) Change CSS in /admin and HTML in /templates/admin to make the admin interface prettier

Tom
---
* Pagination
* Submitted flag for projectsubmit
* Submission should redirect with to the submit page with the flag checked (activating JS function), not to main page
* Just appending i. to imgur.com/whatever doesn't work -- can't append necessary filename!
* Users should be able to leave certain fields intentionally blank - fields like demoURL, thumbnail_url, etc. are not strictly necessary. (Maybe check if user is sure if they are not filled in)
