	        <p>The Dining Philosophers are the University of Pennsylvania's Computer Science
	        interest group.  We hold events for the Computer Science department, including
	        guest lectures, faculty lunches, and social events.  One of our members sits in on the
	        faculty meetings to represent the undergraduate Computer Science body.  We also
	        host an annual programming contest for high school students called the
	        Philadelphia Classic.  It's also a great place to get to know other computer
	        science students and stay connected within the computer
	        science community at large.

	        <h2>Why are we called the Dining Philosophers?</h2>
	        <p>
	          Our name comes from a classic
	          computer science problem.  A group of
	          philosophers sit around a table with a plate in front of them and a chopstick
	          in between each person.  All the philosophers do is eat or think.  The
	          philosophers have to pick up chopsticks on each side to be
	          able to eat but they can only pick them up one at a time.  Once a philosopher
	          tries to eat, he won't put down a chopstick until he finishes eating.  This is
	          a classic case of a possible deadlock scenario.  If each philospher picks up
	          the chopstick to their left, then none of the philosophers will be able to eat
	          and since none of them will also put down the chopstick, all of them will be
	          stuck.  More information about this problem can be
	          found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem">here</a>.
